        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">1978</h2>
        <p>
          " At that time, I didn’t even know you could become an astronaut. Nobody was there to tell me: you have to do this, you have to be there ... I just knew I wanted to be like one of those fellows in a diving suit that I had posted in my room. "
        </p>
        <h2>1996</h2>
        <p>
          " It’s the greatest regret in my life. I moved to a few tenths of a point of mention very well. If I had known, I would have been a little more serious, because I had a tendency to laugh and not always do my homework. I wasn’t perfect! "
        </p>
        <h2>2001</h2>
        <p>
          " I was deeply involved in my studies at the “Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l'Aéronautique et de l’Espace” of Toulouse. Even though I didn’t imagine myself as an astronaut, I knew that if I sacrificed my weekends, I would be able to do something great. "
        </p>
        <h2>2006</h2>
        <p>
          " My time as a pilot at Air France was a very significant time in my life. It is thanks to my 2,000 hours in an Airbus A320 that I can safely apprehend my journey in space. "
        </p>
        <h2>2008</h2>
        <p>
          " There was a selection in 1992, the next one was in 2008 ... Europe is recruiting young people only every sixteen years! If you’re not lucky enough to be of the prescribed age (between 27 and 37) at the right time, it's fucked up. To enroll, you also must hold a certification of five years’ higher education and be specialized in medicine, biology, research, engineering or pilotage. "
        </p>
        <h2>2009</h2>
        <p>
          " I recall it well. One Monday night, my phone rings. A DHR from the European Space Agency asks me: "Do you still want to become an astronaut?" I was so amazed that I couldn’t jump for joy. The gentleman on the phone even asked me, "Are you sure it pleased you?" I realized what happened to me when we opened the champagne with my friends that same evening. Of the 8,413 applicants, we were six to be selected. I was the only Frenchman. "
